This repository contains the code for Stack Overflow's April 1 2016 game, Unikong. Inspired by Donkey Kong, unicorns, and a good excuse to learn some [Phaser](http://phaser.io/). (Specifically, Phaser 2.4.6.)

There's nothing in this code that screams "best practice!", but it's a decent example of a complete game with concerns relatively separated.

A couple things changed since the game ran on Stack Overflow proper:

- pausing now works when "continuing" the game after a win;
- Joystix Monospace font has been replaced everywhere it's not baked into a static image due to the font's licensing constraints.

This version of the game is playable [here](http://stackexchange.github.io/unikong).
